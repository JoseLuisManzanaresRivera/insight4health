        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently the US has become the leading epicenter for the COVID-19 epidemic, given the massive daily movement of people between the US and Mexico, the international border represents a key potential spreading &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/html/border.html&quot;&gt;point&lt;/a&gt;. As of march 31st all the US border states have confirmed cases. How the binational daily activities at the border may contribute to the expansion of this emerging global health treat? And what are the expected economic impacts of the businesses shutdown and custumers lockdown at the border cities? These are some relevant questions that are been examined by local authorities to better face this current...</description>

        <title>Reliable information to improve health care outcomes.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight4health&lt;/strong&gt; provides a platform to analyze public health trends in Mexico’s Nothern border. Currently the US Mexico border region represent a huge emerging market in terms of health care information. The project &lt;strong&gt;Insight4health&lt;/strong&gt; incorporates data science tools that transforms data from several sources, both public and private, into detailed input for acurate decision making.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Generating evidence that contributes to design strategies to efficiently allocate resources is a permanent task that is relevant particularly when dealing with high cost diseases. Having access to reliable information becomes key to achieve this goal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;unleash-data-science-potential-to-analyze-public-health-patterns&quot;&gt;Unleash data science potential to analyze public...</description>

        <title>20 years of Type II Diabetes mortality at Mexican border states.</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the importance of geographic location to explain this epidemic, in the past decades the study of biological risk factors has been the dominant paradigm (Graves and Kayal, 2008; Stolar 2010).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although diabetes is a major public health problem in &lt;strong&gt;Mexico&lt;/strong&gt; previously thought to be related to population with relative higher income levels or affluent, recent studies had suggested an epidemiological transition impacting individuals in lower income regions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies conducted with a focus on the Mexican population suggest that this transition may be linked to nutritional changes (Seuring, Goryakin &amp;amp; Suhrcke, 2015). Argument that highlights the importance to...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;strong&gt;Rhinitis&lt;/strong&gt; describes a disease characterized by an inflammation of the nasal mucosa. Unleashed by an immune system overreaction against particular trigger factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms can evolve taking a chronic or acute pattern. As well as appear in an intermittent fashion (Rombaux &amp;amp; Hellings 2014).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Complications related to this health condition in the group of chronic inferior respiratory airways problems, include diseases with a high impact on life quality of the family as well as considered as high management cost such as allergic asthma, &lt;strong&gt;(J450)&lt;/strong&gt; (Gutiérrez-Cardona et al. 2017).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or comorbidities that affect superior airways including diseases such as chronic...</description>

This pattern surpassed by 60% the dynamics observed by the overall causes of death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This report documents Mexico´s suicide evolution in time during the period 1998-2017 with a focus on &lt;strong&gt;Aguascalientes&lt;/strong&gt; State.

Bennewitz, 1924&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;During 2016, in Mexico there were 82 764 newborn babies diagnosed with birth defects, in a range of 797 different diseases. Although 51% of the cases concentrated in just 10 different causes, respiratory distress syndrome of newborn (ICD code: P220) represent the third highest frequency cause in the country with 4 996 cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This report documents the geographic distribution of the Newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS) cases as well as their time evolution...</description>

The study of its &lt;strong&gt;spatial distribution&lt;/strong&gt; can contribute to implement target preventive and control strategies allowing a reduction of the social cost and financial burden for the health care system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Social determinants of economic origin such as income levels or consumption patterns are two research areas of concern. Income conditions are a key component of poverty which in turn influence health care access mechanisms such as early detection, treatment options and management decisions. In the other hand, consumption patterns represent a latent exposure mechanism to compounds and...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the last decade, hypertensive diseases in Mexico has shown an increasing pattern that reveals a pubic health issue of concern with growing cost. This upward trend is particularly important in specific regions of the country such as the southern border, a region comprised by five states: Chiapas, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Yucatán y Tabasco.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This report analyzes patterns of mortality due to &lt;strong&gt;hypertensive diseases&lt;/strong&gt; in the southern border of Mexico, as well as the evolution of such mortality in the 1998-2014 period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hypertension is defined as a condition where a sustained increase in the blood pressure takes place, with...</description>

Among these, health care access has become a key public concern.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This work examines medical services providers’ spatial location patterns at the Mexican cities in the &lt;strong&gt;US-Mexico border&lt;/strong&gt; as a case study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Formal statistical methods are applied using data sources for each side of the border with the primary source being the National Statistic Directory of Economic Units...</description>
