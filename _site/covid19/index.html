                <p>Recently the US has become the leading epicenter for the COVID-19 epidemic, given the massive daily movement of people between the US and Mexico, the international border represents a key potential spreading point. As of march 31st all the US border states have confirmed cases. 
How the binational daily activities at the border may contribute to the expansion of this emerging global health treat?  And what are the expected economic impacts of the businesses shutdown and custumers lockdown at the border cities? 
These are some relevant questions that are been examined by local authorities to better face this current health emergency.</p>

<h2 id="binational-community-transmission">Binational community transmission.</h2>

<p>At border cities in the Sonora Arizona region such as Nogales, the first covid19 case was reported on March 31st. A 65 years old lady that visited the city of Phoenix, Az. and returned to the Mexican side on March 16th. After 6 days of her return, she stated to develop symptoms.</p>

<p>It took fifteen days to detect this patient.  This case shows a <strong>critical time frame</strong> for diagnosis and the potential for local spreading the virus.</p>

<p>Living at the border in a viral pandemic situation means sharing a common path for transmission. While the evidence of local community transmission at the Arizona Sonora Border region has beginning to emerge, social distancing measures continue to be strengthened.</p>

As of march 31st all the US border states have confirmed cases. 
How the binational daily activities at the border may contribute to the expansion of this emerging global health treat?  And what are the expected economic impacts of the businesses shutdown and custumers lockdown at the border cities? 
These are some relevant questions that are been examined by local authorities to better face this current health emergency.

Binational community transmission.

At border cities in the Sonora Arizona region such as Nogales, the first covid19 case was reported on March 31st. A 65 years old lady that visited the city of Phoenix, Az. and returned to the Mexican side on March 16th. After 6 days of her return, she stated to develop symptoms.

It took fifteen days to detect this patient.  This case shows a critical time frame for diagnosis and the potential for local spreading the virus.

Living at the border in a viral pandemic situation means sharing a common path for transmission. While the evidence of local community transmission at the Arizona Sonora Border region has beginning to emerge, social distancing measures continue to be strengthened.

Tracing Travel path. First covid19 patient. Nogales,Sonora.
