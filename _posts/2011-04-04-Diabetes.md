title: 20 years of Type II Diabetes mortality at Mexican border states.
subtitle: Analysis on Diabetes trends from a regional perspective.
description: The evolution of type II diabetes as a death cause in Mexico increased by 97.6% during the period between 1998-2017, while the over all death causes experienced a 44.3% increase in same period. The exponential growth rate implicit by this trend reflects a public health concern of epidemic proportions.

> Despite the importance of geographic location to explain this epidemic, in the past decades the study of biological risk factors has been the dominant paradigm (Graves and Kayal, 2008; Stolar 2010).

Although diabetes is a major public health problem in **Mexico** previously thought to be related to population with relative higher income levels or affluent, recent studies had suggested an epidemiological transition impacting individuals in lower income regions. 

Studies conducted with a focus on the Mexican population suggest that this transition may be linked to nutritional changes (Seuring, Goryakin & Suhrcke, 2015). Argument that highlights the importance to consider **social determinants of health** such as consumption patterns as contextual factors to understand this growing public health treat. 

Studies emphasizing **behavioral determinants** have established that inadequate diet is a key risk factor for the development of T2D (Sundquist, Eriksson, Mezuk & Ohlsson, 2015; Wali, Thomas & Sutherland, 2014). According to Ortiz-Hernández (2006), a link towards diabetes development through consumption practices finds a key path via the metabolic energy intake balance; the path identified can be traced back to life style habits further pressured by low price per calories processed foods available at the neighborhood scale. 

As evidence suggest, diet follow trends tied to consumption practices that differ across demographic groups and regions (Gordon-Larsen, Guilkey and Popkin, 2011). Although it is recognized that T2D is a multifactorial public health issue and its determinants are not limited to consumption patterns, considering contextual factors may provide additional insights to improve its understanding at a regional scale.
