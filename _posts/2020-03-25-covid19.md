How the binational daily activities at the border may contribute to the expansion of this emerging global health treat?  And what are the expected economic impacts of the business shutdown at the border cities? Are some relevant questions that are been examined to better face this current health emergency.

## Binational community transmission.

At border cities in the Sonora Arizona region such as Nogales, the first covid19 case was reported on March 31st. A 65 years old lady that visited the city of Phoenix, Az. and returned to the Mexican side on March 16th. After 6 days of her return, she stated to develop symptoms.

It took fifteen days to detect this patient.  This case shows a critical time frame for diagnosis and the potential for local spreading the virus.

Living  at the border in a pandemic situation means sharinG  a common path for viral trasnmission and there’s  now evidence of local community transmission so social distancing measures should be strengthen.
