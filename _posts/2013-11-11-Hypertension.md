During the last decade, hypertensive diseases in Mexico has shown an increasing pattern that reveals a pubic health issue of concern with growing cost. This upward trend is particularly important in specific regions of the country such as the southern border, a region comprised by five states:  Chiapas, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Yucatán y Tabasco. 

This report analyzes patterns of mortality due to **hypertensive diseases** in the southern border of Mexico, as well as the evolution of such mortality in the 1998-2014 period. 


> Hypertension is defined as a condition where a sustained increase in the blood pressure takes place, with a reference threshold in systolic blood pressure (SBP)≥140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg. This process creates a set of changes at the vascular structure that may lead to metabolic unbalances such as renal failure and heart failure.


The emphasis is directed at the causes **Essential (primary) hypertension** (I10X) and “**Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure**” (I110). Using data from the mortality records of the National Health Information System, two types of analyses were carried out: **cross-sectional analysis** and time trends. 

Over the 16 years included in the study, the age-adjusted mortality rates show a clear increase. The findings suggest that the higher presence of **indigenous populations** is a group of importance in the determination of the mortality pattern, with the state of Yucatán a case of particular interest. 
In addition, it is the female population the populaton group that exhibits the greatest adverse impact.
