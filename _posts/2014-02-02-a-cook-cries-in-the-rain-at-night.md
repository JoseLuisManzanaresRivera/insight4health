Sonora, a Mexican state located at the US border, historically has been conducting a dynamic mining activity as part of a natural productive potential that extends beyond the border. 

>Mining activities in particular copper extraction have been defining human binational relations in the Sonora-Arizona, region however until recently the environmental impacts regarding the relation mining activity waste-water quality and public health are beginning to emerge as a general concern among the population along this interconnected region. 

The aim of this work is to analyze the spatial distribution of potential **pollution pathways of water resources** given the economic activity in the Mexican border state of Sonora  and  propose  a  regional  distribution  in  relation  to  cancer  mortality  rates  across the state.

The methodology considers two sources of primary data: wastewater discharge concessions registered in the Public registry on Water rights [Registro Público de Derechos de Agua] (REPDA) and the records generated by the National Health information System [Sistema Nacional de Información en  Salud] (SINAIS) in the period 1998-2011 based on the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10).

Results provide evidence that support projected adjustments to regulation  **NOM-250-SSA1-2014**, which controls a subset of pollutants common in **mining activity surroundings**.
