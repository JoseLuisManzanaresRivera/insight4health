We  aim to contrast the territorial distribution of demand for oncological services with respect to the availability of specialists to provide care. Lung cancer mortality rates adjusted by age distribution for the country’s 32 states between 1998 and 2017 are estimated.

Despite reductions in lung cancer mortality patterns in Mexico in the last two decades, the analysis showed persistent areas of opportunity for improvement, mainly for the female population of Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Puebla states. Based on this research, the main recommendation for aiming efforts to manage this oncological disease in Mexico is to determine whether these patterns are associated with smoking habits or with other social determinants.
