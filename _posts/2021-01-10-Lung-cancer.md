description: Deaths from lung cancer in Mexico dropped by 14.5% between the period prior to implementation of the General Law on Tobacco Control and the year 2017. A 22% reduction was observed for the male population by the end of the entire 20 year study period. There is evidence of an  imbalance between the demand for oncological services and the availability of specialists.

We  aim to contrast the territorial distribution of demand for oncological services with respect to the availability of specialists to provide care. Lung cancer mortality rates adjusted by age distribution for the country’s 32 states between 1998 and 2017 are estimated.

Despite reductions in lung cancer mortality patterns in Mexico in the last two decades, the analysis showed persistent areas of opportunity for improvement, mainly for the female population of Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Puebla states. Based on this research, the main recommendation for aiming efforts to manage this oncological disease in Mexico is to determine whether these patterns are associated with smoking habits or with other social determinants.
