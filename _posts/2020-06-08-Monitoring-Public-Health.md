One of the challenges identified to design effective colon cancer control strategies on a global scale is to have monitoring instruments to measure its evolution.  in this study we provide evidence for the monitoring of mortality from colon cancer in Mexico, integrating the spatial and temporal dimension ina  17-year  period  from  1998 to  2015.

The  evidence  found  is a  data  driven  source to guide control  actions  in  specific populations,  that  may  improve  resource  allocation.
