Given the recent growth trend by chronic diseases taken place in some Latin American countries such as Mexico, conducting research using a spatial approach is consider as a relevant way to provide insight into this public health treat. 

The aim is to study the temporal and spatial pattern of chronic renal disease in Mexico during the last decade, explicitly considering socioeconomic determents, in particular the link to water quality.

Official microdata is analyzed based on the social and environmental determinants of health theoretical paradigm. Results allow to identify patterns at the State geographic
scale. For Aguascalientes, one of the highest occurrence states, a relationship between kidney disease occurrence and negative water quality parameters was detected, suggesting possible areas for further research and to develop preventive strategies.
