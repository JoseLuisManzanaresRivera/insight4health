title: Spatial and temporal Expressions of chronic Kidney Disease in Mexico 
subtitle: A Social and environmental determinants approach.
description: In Mexico, the growth of chronic health conditions seen in recent decades, represents a serious public health problem. As part of this phenomena, the rise in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a topic of concern given its adverse social impacts.

Given the recent growth trend by chronic diseases taken place in some Latin American countries such as Mexico, conducting research using a spatial approach is consider as a relevant way to provide insight into this public health treat. 

CDK treatment include high cost procedures such as hemodialysis  or in advanced stages a need for transplants, thus contributing to understand Chronic kidney disease determinants is considered a relevant area of research with great social benefits.

The aim of this report is to study the temporal and spatial pattern of chronic renal disease in Mexico during the last decade, explicitly considering socioeconomic determents, in particular the link to water quality.

Official microdata is analyzed based on the social and environmental determinants of health theoretical paradigm. Results allow to identify patterns at the State geographic
scale. For Aguascalientes, one of the highest occurrence states, a relationship between kidney disease occurrence and negative water quality parameters was detected, suggesting possible areas for further research and to develop preventive strategies.
