> Too often health professionals are focused on what is simpler, that is treat a medical or mental illness, whereas facing suicide risk goes beyond the traditional approach and involves human understanding of suffering.”
Maurizio Pompili.2018

During the last 20 years, suicide as a death cause in Mexico, reach a 74.8% growth, which translates into a 3.74% annual increase rate. This pattern surpassed by 60% the dynamics observed by the overall causes of death. 


This report  documents Mexico´s suicide evolution in time during the period 1998-2017 with a focus on **Aguascalientes** State. The methodology is based on exploratory data analysis using public mortality records collected by the national system for health information for two different data structures, cross section and time series. 

In addition, for the first time **Google trends** data was collected to the study suicide for Mexican States.  Using the search term “suicide” at the state scale a bivariate least squares regression model was tested to examine its relation to observed mortality rates. 

Results provide current information from a geographic perspective useful to design surveillance strategies in accordance with the World Health Organization WHO, (2013) action plan on **mental health**.
