**Insight4health** provides a platform to analyze public health trends in   Mexico. Currently Latin American countries represent a huge emerging market in terms of health care information. **Insight4health** incorporates data science tools that transforms data from several sources, both  public and private, into detailed input for acurate decision making.

>  *Generating evidence that contributes to design strategies to efficiently allocate resources is a permanent task that is relevant particularly when dealing with high cost diseases. Having access to reliable information becomes key to achieve this goal*.

## Unleash data science potential to analyze public health patterns.    

We incorporate a data driven approach to discover health trends. **I4H** specializes in Mexico´s health conditions at a regional scale.   Reports generated by insight4health are inputs to guide market strategies to tackle health care demands, particularly targeting preventive measures.

In **I4H**, helping health care provides to achieve an efficient allocation of resources is key premise, so we emphasize the cost implications of public health conditions.

Where to invest, either in health care facilities or hire particular medical specialist requires a knowledge base decision framework.

Detecting whether a particular disease is occurring as an emerging trend or is a result of a long-term pattern may contribute to the decision-making process for the health care environment. 

From a theoretical stand point, social and environmental determinants of health represent key areas of research that explain important risk factors for many health conditions including some types of cancer and current epidemic diseases such as type II diabetes.

Applying data sciences tools to explore these connections is a relevant feature of the **insight4health** approach. We consider that time and space may contribute to undertand the causes of the causes of desease. 

So, we invite you to benefit from insight4health analysis.  Having access to current, reliable information means value.  Try **insight4health**!  


**Insight4health** was created by  [José Luis Manzanares Rivera](https://www.colef.mx/posgrado/profesores/borrador-automatico-31/) as an effort to disseminate  research in the Health economics domain.
