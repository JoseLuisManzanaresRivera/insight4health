This work examines medical services providers’ spatial location patterns at the Mexican cities in the **US-Mexico border** as a case study. 

Formal statistical methods are applied using data sources for each side of the border with the primary source being the National Statistic Directory of Economic Units (DENUE) published by the Mexican Census Bureau. 

We identify the following specific medical services activities with particular relative concentrations at the border city scale: **private dental offices** (NAICS code 621211) ci= 1.32, **general medicine private offices** (NAICS code 621111) ci = 1.16, **private medical diagnostics labs** (NAICS code 621511) ci = 1.02, and **private general hospitals** (NAICS code 621398) ci = 1.03. 

In addition, a cluster pattern around border crossings was found for the largest city included in the study. Results suggest that **trans-border health care** needs in the region represent a binational integration mechanism with social opportunities for the local populations.
